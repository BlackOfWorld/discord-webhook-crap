# **discord-webhook-crap**
Stuff I used to troll people on Discord.
# How to run
1) Install Node.js (if you don't have it)
2) Clone or download the repo.
3) Create `webhooks.txt` and `quotes.txt` if they don't exist
4) Put your webhooks to webhooks.txt and your texts to quotes.txt (if you want to use the raid version)
5) Now run the files below depending on what you want to do. \
`webhook_chat.js` to have a more freedom.   
`webhook_raid.js` to use all the webhooks and send messages from `quotes.txt` (change the settings in the js file).
6) Have fun!
